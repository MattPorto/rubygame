 == What is Rubygame?

 Rubygame is a cross-platform game-development library for Ruby,
 inspired by Pygame. Rubygame strives to empower game developers by
 providing them with powerful and flexible mid-to-high level tools.
 Instead of worrying about low-level technical details, you can focus
 your energy on more interesting things (like making a fun game).

 == Requirements

 You will definitely need these software packages to use Rubygame:

 * Ruby          >= 1.8 
 * Ruby-SDL-FFI  >= 0.1
 * SDL           >= 1.2.7   (1.2.14 on MacOS X 10.6)
 * (MacOS X only): RSDL  ( http://github.com/knu/rsdl )

 It's highly recommended that you have these packages as well, or some
 cool features won't be available!

 * SDL_gfx     >= 2.0.13
 * SDL_image   >= 1.2.3
 * SDL_mixer   >= 1.2.7
 * SDL_ttf     >= 2.0.6


 == Install

 === Basic Install

 The simplest way to install is with RubyGems:

  $ sudo gem install rubygame

 Another way is to install directly from the source:

  $ sudo rake install

 Or generate and install a gem from the source:

  $ rake gem
  $ sudo gem install pkg/rubygame-*.gem

 === Generating documentation

 You can generate documentation for Rubygame's API by running:

  $ rake rdoc

 Documentation will be generated as HTML in the 'html' directory.
 Open 'html/index.html' in a web browser to get started.


 == Usage
 
 See the documentation (online at http://docs.rubygame.org, or
 generated locally with the 'rake rdoc' command). 

 We also recommend that you take a peek at the demo applications in
 the 'samples' directory, especially image_viewer.rb,
 demo_rubygame.rb, and chimp.rb.

 Some of the sample files are distributed under licenses other than
