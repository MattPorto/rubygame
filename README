Rubygame README
============

	Rubygame is based on Ruby/SDL [1] and pygame [2], intended to provide
	functionality similar to pygame, but for those who prefer Ruby over Python.

	Note that while I intend to make it as easy to make games in Ruby as it is
	to make games in Python, this is not just a clone of pygame. This is to say,
	where there are opportunities to improve the layout (particularly to make it
	more object-oriented), I will attempt to make those improvements.

	Many of the tutorials and examples for pygame will work with Rubygame, 
	after some minor modification, so I encourage you to consult those as well.

Requirements
------------

	Rubygame has been tested (and was developed) on the following,
	although older/newer versions might work:

		* ruby 1.8
		* SDL 1.2.7
		* SDL_gfx 2.0.10
		* SDL_image 1.2.3
		* SDL_ttf 2.0.6

	If you are compiling from source you will also need the following:
		* a compiler, like gcc. gcc-3.3.2 to 3.3.4 are known to work.

	If you are using a binary-based ditribution (like Debian, Fedora, SuSe, 
	Slackware, etc.) you will also need the "dev" packages of ruby, SDL,
	SDL_gfx, SDL_image, and SDL_ttf in order to compile Rubygame.

Install
-------

	Decompress archive and enter its top directory.
	Then type:

		$ ruby setup.rb config
		$ ruby setup.rb setup
		# ruby setup.rb install

	You can also install files into your favorite directory
	by supplying setup.rb some options. Try "ruby setup.rb --help".

Usage
-----

	To use Rubygame in an application, do:

		require 'rubygame'

	You will probably also want a display window and event queue:

		screen = Rubygame::Display.set_mode( [640,480] )
		queue = Rubygame::Queue.instance()

	For more information, see the documentation in the "doc/" folder or
	online at rubygame.seul.org
