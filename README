Rubygame README
============

	Rubygame is loosely based on Ruby/SDL [1] and pygame [2], intended
	to provide functionality similar to pygame, but for those who 
	prefer Ruby over Python. It was born out of a need (specifically,
	MY need) for a clean, convenient Ruby-to-SDL binding. If Rubygame
	isn't your cup of tea, you might also check out RUDL [3].

	Note that while I intend to make it as easy to make games in Ruby
	as it is to make games in Python, this is not just a clone of 
	pygame. This is to say, where there are opportunities to improve
	the layout (particularly to make it more object-oriented), I will
	attempt to make those improvements.

	Many of the tutorials and examples for pygame will work with 
	Rubygame, after some minor modification, so I encourage you to 
	consult those as well.

Requirements
------------

	Rubygame has been tested (and was developed) on the following,
	although older/newer versions might work:

		* ruby        1.8    -  1.8.2
		* SDL         1.2.7  -  1.2.8
		* SDL_gfx     2.0.10 -  2.0.12
		* SDL_image   1.2.3  -  1.2.4
		* SDL_ttf     2.0.6  -  2.0.7

	If you are compiling source, you will also need the following:
		* gcc         3.3.2  -  3.4.3
			(other compilers might work too)

	If you are compiling source on a binary-based ditribution
	(i.e., not Gentoo or LFS) you will also need the "dev" packages
	of ruby, SDL, SDL_gfx, SDL_image, and SDL_ttf.

Install
-------

	Decompress archive and enter its top directory.
	Then run ($ indicates as user, # as root):

		$ ruby setup.rb config
		$ ruby setup.rb setup
		# ruby setup.rb install

	You can also install files into your favorite directory by
	supplying setup.rb some options. Try "ruby setup.rb --help".

Usage
-----

	To use Rubygame in an application, do:

		require 'rubygame'

	You will probably also want a display window and event queue:

		screen = Rubygame::Display.set_mode( [640,480] )
		queue = Rubygame::Queue.instance()

	For more information, see the documentation in the "doc/" folder
	or online at http://rubygame.seul.org
