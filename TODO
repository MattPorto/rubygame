= TODO / ROADMAP

=== 3.0.0 (next major release)

- Backwards compatibility will be broken:
  - Surface#get_at
  - Sprites::Group#collide_group

- New scene/camera/sprite sytem.
- New geometric primitives classes (for collision detection, drawing).
- New hook-based event handler system.

- Keyboard events to be :symbols (e.g. :uparrow, :a, :spacebar)

- Clock class to be based on Ruby's timer (allows multi-threading). 
- New TickEvent returned from Clock#tick.

- Change Sprites::Group#collide_group to scrap the 'killa/killb' stuff,
  take a block instead.

=== On the horizon...

- Path (Curve?) (graphs/plots for tracing position and other uses)
  - Can find the position N units along the path.
  - Can draw a line showing the path.
  - LinearPath (connect the dots, linear interpolation)
  - BezierPath (chain of continuous cubic BÃ©zier curves)
  - CodePath (calculated from a code block)

- Better support for non-US keyboards, particularly generating strings for
  keypresses: (EURO, WORLD*). Will need someone with a non-US keyboard to
  test this.

- Flesh out Mixer API.

- Flesh out Rect unit tests.

- C equivalent of Rect.new_from_object (see rect.rb)
  - Screen#update (cannot pass object with rect attribute)
  - Screen#update_rects (same as above)
  - Why not just call the ruby function from within C?

- Generate bounding Polygon from an image automatically.
