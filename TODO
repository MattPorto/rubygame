= TODO / ROADMAP

=== 2.0.1 (next patch release)

- Use rb_scan_args! Better for my health! :) See: http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/04/c_extension_authors_use_rb_sca_1.html
- Fix segfaults with passing incorrect argument type (esp. when expecting 
  Array).
- Use duck typing: rb_check_array_type. (Accepts anything that can be converted
  to an Array with #to_a.)
- Screen#update and Screen#update_rects now clip Rects that are out of bounds,
  to avoid segfaults.
- Ftor#magnitude= now behaves correctly.
- Rect#clip! now behaves correctly.
- Sprites::Group#collide_group now behaves correctly.

=== 2.1.0 (next minor release)

- Mixer::Music module (patch from Johan Berntsson)

- Color (representation of a color)
  - ColorRGB and ColorHSV classes
  - Mix/combine colors using various blending modes (add, multiply, etc.)
  - Library of common pre-defined colors. (:red, :black, :chartreuse, etc.)
  - Integrate with SDL/OpenGL functions (automatic conversion).

=== 3.0.0 (next major release)

- OpenGL-based 2D scene/view/object model.
- Geometric primitives classes (collision detection, drawing).
- Keyboard events keysyms to be :symbols (e.g. :uparrow, :a, :spacebar)
- Clock class to be based on Ruby's timer (allows multi-threading). 
  Units change to seconds (as a float), not milliseconds (as an integer).

- Change Sprites::Group#collide_group to scrap the 'killa/killb' stuff,
  take a block instead.

=== On the horizon...

- Path (Curve?) (graphs/plots for tracing position and other uses)
  - Can find the position N units along the path.
  - Can draw a line showing the path.
  - LinearPath (connect the dots, linear interpolation)
  - BezierPath (chain of continuous cubic BÃ©zier curves)
  - CodePath (calculated from a code block)

- Better support for non-US keyboards, particularly generating strings for
  keypresses: (EURO, WORLD*). Will need someone with a non-US keyboard to
  test this.

- Flesh out Mixer API.

- Flesh out Rect unit tests.

- C equivalent of Rect.new_from_object (see rect.rb)
  - Screen#update (cannot pass object with rect attribute)
  - Screen#update_rects (same as above)
  - Why not just call the ruby function from within C?
