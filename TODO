= TODO / ROADMAP

=== 2.0.1

- Use rb_scan_args! Better for my health! :) See: http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/04/c_extension_authors_use_rb_sca_1.html

- Improve argument checking for methods written in C, especially when an Array
  is expected as an argument. See Bug 1704064 ('Many methods segfault...')
  - Do we need to make sure color components are between 0 and 255 before
    we pass them to SDL functions?

=== On the horizon...

- Flesh out Mixer API.

- Flesh out Rect unit tests.

- C equivalent of Rect.new_from_object (see rect.rb)
  - Screen#update (cannot pass object with rect attribute)
  - Screen#update_rects (same as above)
  - Why not just call the ruby function from within C?

=== Off in space somewhere...

- Add draw_bezier (SDL_gfx's bezierRGBA)

- Add hq2x, hq3x, hq4x scaling -- http://www.hiend3d.com/hq3x.html

- Should UpdateGroup union highly-overlapping rectangles for efficiency? (non-unioning may be a desirable behavior)

- LimitGroup#add could be more efficient (replace many sprites at the
  same time, rather than doing it one by one.) Very low priority.

- Better support for non-US keyboards, particularly generating strings for
  keypresses: (EURO, WORLD*). Will need someone with a non-US keyboard to
  test this.
