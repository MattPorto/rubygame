Rubygame TODO:

Features:
	- Clock class:
		- Rubygame apps freeze when limiting FPS, esp. if window loses focus
	- Draw module:
		- pie and polygon functions do not work (SegFault)
		- maybe add bezier curve
	- Sound/music playback (SDL_Sound, OpenAL?)
	- Transform module:
		- hq2x, hq3x, hq4x -- http://www.hiend3d.com/hq3x.html
	- CD playback

Internal:
	- use -Wall or be smote!
	- C equivalent of rect_from_object (see rect.rb) (better than rect_entry)
		- Screen#update (cannot pass object with rect attribute)
		- Screen#update_rects (same as above)
	- More argument checking! Make sure arguments are the right type.
		- NUM2INT, etc. check if it is a Numeric? Works with Floats?
		- make sure color values are between 0 and 255?
	- Surface#blit should return affected area: Rect [dst_x,dst_y,src_w,src_h]
	- UpdateGroup union highly-overlapping rectangles to be more efficient.
	- LimitGroup#add could be more efficient (remove multiple, use super)
	- Better support for non-US keyboards, particularly generating strings for
	  keypresses. (EURO, WORLD)
